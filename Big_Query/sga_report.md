### **SGA Weekly Performance Report: November 23, 2025**

This report analyzes SGA performance, identifies conversion bottlenecks, and provides actionable coaching recommendations to drive growth.

### 1. QTD Leaderboard

#### **Inbound SGAs**
The Inbound team continues to deliver exceptional results, with both members far exceeding their quarterly goals.

-   **🥇 Top Performer: Lauren George**
    -   **21 QTD SQOs** (210.0% of 10 SQO goal)
-   **Jacqueline Tully**
    -   **13 QTD SQOs** (144.4% of 9 SQO goal)

#### **Outbound SGAs**
The Outbound team shows strong performance at the top, with several SGAs already at or above their quarterly goal. However, there is a clear divide between the leaders and those struggling to gain traction.

-   **🥇 Top Performer: Russell Armitage**
    -   **15 QTD SQOs** (125.0% of 12 SQO goal)
-   **Eleni Stefanopoulos**
    -   **12 QTD SQOs** (100.0% of 12 SQO goal)
-   **Craig Suchodolski**
    -   **6 QTD SQOs** (50.0% of 12 SQO goal)
-   **Channing Guyer**
    -   **5 QTD SQOs** (55.6% of 9 SQO goal)
-   **Chris Morgan**
    -   **5 QTD SQOs** (41.7% of 12 SQO goal)
-   **Amy Waller**
    -   **4 QTD SQOs** (44.4% of 9 SQO goal)
-   **Helen Kamens**
    -   **4 QTD SQOs** (44.4% of 9 SQO goal)
-   **Perry Kalmeta**
    -   **4 QTD SQOs** (40.0% of 10 SQO goal)
-   **Ryan Crandall**
    -   **4 QTD SQOs** (40.0% of 10 SQO goal)

#### **Who is at Zero? (Immediate Attention)**

-   **Marisa Saucedo (Post-Ramp):** **CRITICAL.** Marisa has 0 QTD SQOs against a goal of 11. She is 70 days post-ramp and needs immediate coaching intervention to diagnose activity and conversion issues.
-   **Brian O'Hara (On Ramp):** Brian is new (7 days tenure) and currently in his 30-day ramp period. Zero production is expected. The focus should be on training and onboarding.

### 2. The "Hot Sheet" (Last 7 Days)

Momentum is key. The following SGAs generated SQOs in the last 7 days, keeping the pipeline warm.

-   **Lauren George (Inbound):** Generated **2 SQOs**, bringing her QTD total to 21 (210% of goal).
-   **Jacqueline Tully (Inbound):** Generated **2 SQOs**, bringing her QTD total to 13 (144% of goal).
-   **Russell Armitage (Outbound):** Generated **2 SQOs**, bringing his QTD total to 15 (125% of goal).
-   **Eleni Stefanopoulos (Outbound):** Generated **2 SQOs**, bringing her QTD total to 12 (100% of goal).

### 3. Calendar Watch

#### **Who has a loaded calendar next week?**
These SGAs have scheduled calls and opportunities to generate pipeline in the coming week.

-   **Amy Waller:** 4 Initial Calls
-   **Chris Morgan:** 1 Qualification Call (Advisor: Greg Giardino, SGM: Corey Marcello)
-   **Craig Suchodolski:** 1 Initial Call
-   **Marisa Saucedo:** 4 Initial Calls
-   **Perry Kalmeta:** 1 Initial Call
-   **Ryan Crandall:** 3 Initial Calls, 1 Qualification Call (Advisor: Danny Beckwith, SGM: Bre McDaniel)

#### **Who has an empty calendar (risk alert)?**
**CRITICAL RISK:** These SGAs have **zero** scheduled calls for next week. They need immediate coaching on activity generation to build pipeline for the end of the quarter.

-   **Channing Guyer**
-   **Eleni Stefanopoulos**
-   **Helen Kamens**
-   **Jacqueline Tully**
-   **Lauren George**
-   **Russell Armitage**

### 4. Coach's Corner (Conversion Diagnostics)

#### **Inbound SGAs**

-   **Lauren George:** A top performer crushing her goal. Her MQL→SQL rate (42.4%) is excellent, well above the team average (25.5%). **Disposition Analysis:** Her MQL losses are heavily skewed towards "Not a Fit" (30.8% vs. team 12.8%), indicating she is highly effective at quickly disqualifying non-ICP leads, which is a strength.
-   **Jacqueline Tully:** Also a top performer. Her conversion rates are stellar across the board, especially MQL→SQL at 72.7% (+47.2pp vs team). **Disposition Analysis:** Her MQL losses are dominated by "No Book" (40%) and "No Show/Ghosted" (40%), both far above team averages. While her results are strong, the high "No Show" rate is an opportunity for process improvement (e.g., enhanced confirmation emails).

#### **Outbound SGAs**

-   **Russell Armitage:** Leading the outbound team. His Contacted→MQL rate (13.2%) is nearly 3x the team average, showing his outreach is highly effective. **Disposition Analysis:** His primary MQL loss reasons are "AUM too Low" (28% vs. team 16.7%) and "No Response" (20% vs. team 6.3%). **Coaching:** The high "No Response" rate suggests an opportunity to refine his follow-up cadence after an initial connection. The "AUM too Low" spike indicates he may be able to improve targeting or pre-qualification to focus on higher-value prospects.

-   **Eleni Stefanopoulos:** Hit her goal this week. However, her MQL→SQL conversion has dropped significantly (12.8% vs. 39.6% lifetime). **Disposition Analysis:** The root cause is a high percentage of MQL losses due to "Timing" (12.9% vs. team 4.9%). **Coaching:** This indicates she is finding interested prospects who aren't ready to move now. Implement a structured long-term nurture strategy to re-engage these "Timing" leads in 3-6 months.

-   **Craig Suchodolski:** His SQL→SQO rate is excellent (91.7%), but his front-of-funnel Contacted→MQL rate is low (2.2% vs. team 4.6%) and has dropped significantly from his lifetime average (5.7%). **Disposition Analysis:** His MQL losses show a high rate of "Not a Fit" (25% vs. team 12.8%). **Coaching:** This suggests a targeting or messaging issue. Review his outreach templates and call scripts to ensure the value proposition is resonating with the right audience.

-   **Channing Guyer:** **CRITICAL BOTTLENECK.** His MQL→SQL conversion is very low (14.3% vs. team 25.5%). **Disposition Analysis:** The reason is crystal clear: **33.3% of his MQL losses are from "No Show / Ghosted"**, compared to a team average of just 6.0%. **Coaching:** This is the #1 priority. Immediately review his call confirmation process. Is he sending calendar invites? Pre-call reminder emails? Is he setting clear expectations for the call? This is a process issue that can be fixed.

-   **Chris Morgan:** **CRITICAL BOTTLENECK.** His MQL→SQL conversion has plummeted to 12.7% from a lifetime average of 31.0%. **Disposition Analysis:** His MQL losses are heavily weighted towards "No Book" (27.5% vs. team 18.6%). **Coaching:** He is spending too much time on advisors who don't have a portable book of business. He needs to refine his qualification questions to identify this earlier in the conversation, potentially even before the first call, to avoid wasting MQL slots.

-   **Amy Waller:** Her SQL→SQO conversion is below average (66.7% vs. team 79.5%). **Disposition Analysis:** Her MQL losses are driven by "No Book" (33.3% vs. team 18.6%) and "Not a Fit" (33.3% vs. team 12.8%). **Coaching:** Amy is getting people on the phone but is discovering late in the process that they are not qualified. Focus on front-loading qualification criteria. Ask about book portability and AUM on the first touch or initial call to disqualify faster.

-   **Helen Kamens:** **CRITICAL BOTTLENECK.** Her SQL→SQO conversion is extremely low (50.0% vs. team 79.5%). **Disposition Analysis:** Her MQL losses are abnormally high for "Auto-Closed by Operations" (25.8% vs. team 5.7%). **Coaching:** This suggests a potential data hygiene or process issue. She needs to review why so many of her leads are being auto-closed. Is she failing to update stages or dispositions correctly? This is an urgent operational issue to resolve.

-   **Perry Kalmeta:** His front-of-funnel conversion (Contacted→MQL) has dropped dramatically (4.5% vs. 15.7% lifetime). **Disposition Analysis:** His MQL losses are disproportionately high for "No Response" (18.2% vs. team 6.3%) and "No Show / Ghosted" (18.2% vs. team 6.0%). **Coaching:** Perry is struggling with engagement. He needs to A/B test new outreach subject lines and review his follow-up cadence. The high no-show rate requires a review of his call-setting and confirmation process.

-   **Ryan Crandall:** His MQL→SQL (13.8%) and SQL→SQO (60.0%) conversions are both well below team averages. **Disposition Analysis:** Like Helen, he has a very high rate of "Auto-Closed by Operations" MQL losses (18.2% vs. team 5.7%). **Coaching:** This is a red flag for process adherence. He needs immediate coaching on CRM hygiene and the lead management process to ensure he's not letting viable leads go stale.

-   **Marisa Saucedo:** **CRITICAL.** At 0 QTD SQOs, the entire funnel needs attention. Her MQL→SQL rate is low (10.6% vs. team 25.5%). **Disposition Analysis:** Her MQL losses are high for "Not Interested in Moving" (21.1% vs. team 15.0%) and "No Response" (10.5% vs. team 6.3%). **Coaching:** This points to a core messaging problem. Her value proposition isn't compelling enough to generate interest or a response. Start with the fundamentals: role-play her initial pitch and review her email templates.

-   **Brian O'Hara (On Ramp):** Focus for Brian is on learning the systems, ICP, and value proposition. Pair him with a top performer like Russell for call shadowing. His metrics are not indicative of performance at this stage.

### 5. Source Alerts

-   **Outbound Channels Weakening:** The two primary outbound sources are showing significant negative trends. **LinkedIn (Self Sourced)** SQO generation is down 1.43pp and **Provided Lead List** is down 1.10pp compared to the 365-day average. This could indicate list fatigue or a need to refresh messaging on these channels for the entire outbound team.
-   **Marketing/Re-Engagement Surging:** This channel is performing exceptionally well, up 46.15pp over the yearly average. This is a major strength to lean into.

### 6. Pipeline Forecast

- **User Data:** `SavvyGTMData.User` - Contains SGA creation dates for ramp period calculations

#### Date Range Dimensions & Filters

1.  **QTD (Quarter to Date):**
    -   Start: First day of current quarter (calculated as: month = (current_month - 1) // 3 * 3 + 1, day = 1)
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Used for: QTD SQO counts, quarterly goal progress

2.  **Last 7 Days:**
    -   Start: Current date - 7 days
    -   End: Current date (inclusive, includes today)
    -   When run on Sunday, this gives Monday-Sunday (8 days total: today + 7 days back)
    -   Date Dimension: `Date_Became_SQO__c` for SQOs, `Initial_Call_Scheduled_Date__c` for initial calls, `Qualification_Call_Date__c` for qualification calls
    -   Used for: Recent production, activity tracking

3.  **Next 7 Days (Upcoming):**
    -   Start: Current date + 1 day (tomorrow, excludes today)
    -   End: Current date + 7 days (7 days total starting from tomorrow)
    -   When run on Sunday, this gives next Monday-Sunday (7 days total: tomorrow + next 6 days)
    -   Date Dimension: `Initial_Call_Scheduled_Date__c` for initial calls, `Qualification_Call_Date__c` for qualification calls
    -   Used for: Calendar visibility, activity planning

4.  **Last 90 Days (Trailing 90):**
    -   Start: Current date - 90 days
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
    -   Used for: Conversion rate trends, activity averages, disposition analysis
    -   **Note:** For conversion rates, this is compared against "Lifetime (Post-Ramp)" which excludes the first 30 days after SGA creation

5.  **Lifetime (Post-Ramp):**
    -   Start: SGA CreatedDate + 30 days (excludes ramp period)
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
    -   Used for: Baseline conversion rates, historical performance comparison

6.  **Trailing 365 Days:**
    -   Start: Current date - 365 days
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
    -   Used for: Channel/source performance comparison (90d vs 365d)

#### Key Calculations

1.  **Conversion Rates:**
    -   **Contacted → MQL:** `COUNT(DISTINCT contacted_to_mql_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_contacted_conversions)`
    -   **MQL → SQL:** `COUNT(DISTINCT mql_to_sql_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_mql_conversions)`
    -   **SQL → SQO:** `COUNT(DISTINCT sql_to_sqo_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_sql_conversions)`
    -   Source: `vw_sga_funnel` view with progression flags
    -   Date filtering: Applied via `FilterDate` field

2.  **Ramp Period Logic:**
    -   SGAs are considered "On Ramp" if `days_since_creation <= 30`
    -   Ramp period = First 30 days after SGA `CreatedDate` from `SavvyGTMData.User`
    -   Lifetime metrics exclude this 30-day period: `WHERE FilterDate >= DATE_ADD(User.CreatedDate, INTERVAL 30 DAY)`

3.  **SQO Deduplication:**
    -   Uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Full_Opportunity_ID__c, SGA_Owner_Name__c ORDER BY Date_Became_SQO__c DESC)`
    -   Ensures each opportunity is counted once per SGA, using the most recent SQO date

4.  **Pipeline Forecast:**
    -   Daily Rate = `QTD SQOs / Days Elapsed in Quarter`
    -   Remaining Days = Total days in quarter - Days elapsed
    -   **December Adjustment:** Days in December are multiplied by 0.67 (33% reduction) to account for holiday season
    -   Projected SQOs = `QTD SQOs + (Daily Rate * Remaining Days)`
    -   For December days: `(Daily Rate * 0.67 * December Days)`

5.  **Contacting Activity:**
    -   Metric: Count of records where `stage_entered_contacting__c` is not null
    -   Average Weekly Contacts = `Total Contacts (Last 90 Days, Post-Ramp) / Weeks in Period`
    -   Weeks in Period = `(Days in Period - Ramp Days) / 7`
    -   Comparison: Last 7 Days contacts vs. Average Weekly Contacts

6.  **Disposition Analysis:**
    -   **Closed Lost MQLs:** `is_mql = 1 AND is_sql = 0 AND Disposition__c IS NOT NULL`
    -   **Closed Lost SQLs:** `is_sql = 1 AND is_sqo = 0 AND Disposition__c IS NOT NULL AND StageName = 'Closed Lost'`
    -   Grouped by `Disposition__c` for each SGA
    -   Compared: Last 90 Days vs. Lifetime (Post-Ramp) vs. Team Aggregate (Last 90 Days)

7.  **Team Aggregate Calculations:**
    -   All team metrics aggregate data across all active SGAs (excluding: 'Savvy Marketing', 'Corey Marcello', 'Bryan Belville', 'Anett Diaz')
    -   Team conversion rates use the same formulas as individual SGAs but aggregate all eligible records
    -   Team disposition analysis aggregates all closed lost MQLs/SQLs across the team

#### Global Filters Applied
-   `IsSGA__c = TRUE` AND `IsActive = TRUE` (from `SavvyGTMData.User`)
-   `SGA_Owner_Name__c NOT IN ('Savvy Marketing', 'Corey Marcello', 'Bryan Belville', 'Anett Diaz')`

#### SGA Segmentation
-   **Inbound SGAs:** Lauren George, Jacqueline Tully (handle inbound leads)
-   **Outbound SGAs:** All other active SGAs (responsible for outbound prospecting)
-   Rankings and comparisons are done within each segment
