-- Daily Forecast View for Looker Studio Cross-Filtering
-- This view calculates daily RATE forecast values (not cumulative)
-- Divides monthly forecasts by days in month to get daily rate
-- SUM across a date range gives the total forecast for that period

WITH
-- 1. Generate date spine for Q4 2025
Date_Spine AS (
  SELECT date_day
  FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_DATE_ARRAY('2025-10-01', '2025-12-31', INTERVAL 1 DAY)) AS date_day
),

-- 2. Get monthly forecast targets from the forecast table (Cohort_source metric only)
Monthly_Forecast_Targets AS (

-- 3. Calculate daily rate (forecast per day for each month)
Daily_Rates AS (

    m.stage,

-- 4. Pivot by stage to get sql_forecast, sqo_forecast, joined_forecast
Forecast_Detail AS (
