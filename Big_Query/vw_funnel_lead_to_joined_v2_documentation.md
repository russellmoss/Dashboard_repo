# vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2 Documentation

## Overview

The `vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2` view creates a unified dataset that tracks prospects/leads through the entire sales funnel, from initial lead creation through conversion to opportunities and ultimately to when advisors join Savvy. This view combines lead and opportunity data to provide a complete funnel view, handling cases where people enter the system as opportunities without ever being leads.

**Location**: `savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2`

---

## Architecture

The view is built using two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) that pull from different source tables:
1. **Lead_Base** - Extracts and enriches lead/prospect data
2. **Opp_Base** - Extracts and enriches opportunity data

The final SELECT statement performs a FULL OUTER JOIN between these CTEs and adds attribution logic.

---

## Primary Key Design

### The Challenge
- Some people enter the funnel as **leads** and later convert to **opportunities**
- Some people enter the funnel directly as **opportunities** (no lead record exists)
- We need a single, consistent way to uniquely identify each person across both source systems

### The Solution
```sql
COALESCE(l.Full_prospect_id__c, o.Full_Opportunity_ID__c) AS primary_key
```

The `primary_key` field uses `COALESCE` to create a unique identifier that:
- Uses the prospect ID if a lead exists
- Falls back to the opportunity ID if no lead exists
- Ensures every record has a unique identifier, regardless of entry point

This allows us to:
- Track the complete journey of leads who convert to opportunities
- Track opportunities that never had a lead record
- Query and analyze the funnel without gaps or duplicates

---

## CTE 1: Lead_Base

**Purpose**: Extract lead/prospect information and calculate funnel stage indicators based on lead status.

**Source Table**: `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Lead`

### Key Fields Extracted

#### Basic Lead Information
- `Full_prospect_id__c` - Unique lead identifier
- `Name` (aliased as `Prospect_Name`) - Name of the prospect
- `CreatedDate` - When the lead was created
- `OwnerID` - Owner of the lead record
- `SGA_Owner_Name__c` - Assigned SGA owner
- `Company` - Company name
- `Status` - Current lead status
- `LeadSource` (aliased as `Lead_Original_Source`) - Original lead source

#### Lead List & Experimentation
- `lead_list_name__c` - List the lead came from
- `Experimentation_Tag__c` - Tag for experiment tracking
- `Disposition__c` - Lead disposition

#### Funnel Stage Timestamps
- `stage_entered_contacting__c` - When lead entered "contacting" stage
- `Initial_Call_Scheduled_Date__c` - When initial call was scheduled
- `stage_entered_new__c` - When lead entered "new" stage
- `Stage_Entered_Call_Scheduled__c` - When lead entered MQL stage (call scheduled)
- `ConvertedDate` - When lead was converted to opportunity
- `ConvertedOpportunityId` - ID of the converted opportunity

### Calculated Fields

#### Funnel Stage Indicators (Binary Flags)
```sql
CASE WHEN stage_entered_contacting__c IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_contacted
```
- **Purpose**: Indicates if the lead has been contacted
- **Logic**: True when the lead entered the "contacting" stage

```sql
CASE WHEN Stage_Entered_Call_Scheduled__c IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_mql
```
- **Purpose**: Indicates if the lead is a Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)
- **Logic**: True when a call was scheduled
- **Business Logic**: MQL is defined as someone who has scheduled an initial call

```sql
CASE WHEN initial_call_scheduled_date__c IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_initial_call
```
- **Purpose**: Indicates if an initial call was scheduled
- **Logic**: Redundant with `is_mql` but provides explicit flag for call scheduling

```sql
CASE WHEN IsConverted IS TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_sql
```
- **Purpose**: Indicates if the lead is a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)
- **Logic**: True when the lead has been converted to an opportunity
- **Note**: SQL definition is simply "converted lead"

```sql
CASE WHEN is_converted_raw IS TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_converted_raw
```
- **Purpose**: Direct copy of Salesforce's `IsConverted` field
- **Note**: Also available as `is_converted_raw` boolean

#### Weekly Bucketing
```sql
FORMAT_DATE('%m/%d/%Y', DATE_TRUNC(DATE(initial_call_scheduled_date__c), WEEK(MONDAY))) AS Week_Bucket_MQL_Call
```
- **Purpose**: Formats the initial call date into a week bucket (e.g., "01/15/2024")
- **Use Case**: Weekly aggregation and reporting

```sql
DATE_TRUNC(DATE(Stage_Entered_Contacting__c), WEEK(MONDAY)) AS Week_Bucket_MQL_Date
```
- **Purpose**: Stores the week start date (Monday) for MQL date
- **Use Case**: Sorting and grouping by week

```sql
FORMAT_DATE('%m/%d/%Y', DATE_TRUNC(DATE(ConvertedDate), WEEK(MONDAY))) AS Week_Bucket_SQL
```
- **Purpose**: Formats the conversion date into a week bucket
- **Use Case**: Weekly SQL conversion reporting

```sql
DATE_TRUNC(DATE(ConvertedDate), WEEK(MONDAY)) AS Week_Bucket_SQL_Date
```
- **Purpose**: Week start date for SQL conversion
- **Use Case**: Sorting and grouping

#### Filter Date
```sql
GREATEST(
  IFNULL(CreatedDate, TIMESTAMP('1900-01-01')),
  IFNULL(stage_entered_new__c, TIMESTAMP('1900-01-01')),
  IFNULL(stage_entered_contacting__c, TIMESTAMP('1900-01-01'))
) AS FilterDate
```
- **Purpose**: Creates a single date field for filtering in dashboards and reports
- **Logic**: Takes the most recent date among creation date and stage entry dates
- **Use Case**: Allows filtering "all activities" by a single date range
- **Default**: Uses '1900-01-01' to ensure NULL safety in GREATEST function

---

## CTE 2: Opp_Base

**Purpose**: Extract opportunity information and enrich with user names from related User records.

**Source Table**: `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Opportunity`

**Filter**: Only includes opportunities where `recordtypeid = '012Dn000000mrO3IAI'` (likely "Advisor" or "FA" record type)

### Key Fields Extracted

#### Basic Opportunity Information
- `Full_Opportunity_ID__c` - Unique opportunity identifier
- `Name` (aliased as `Opp_Name`) - Opportunity name
- `CreatedDate` (aliased as `Opp_CreatedDate`) - When opportunity was created
- `Amount` - Opportunity amount in dollars
- `Underwritten_AUM__c` - Underwritten Assets Under Management
- `StageName` - Current sales stage
- `CloseDate` - Expected or actual close date
- `IsClosed` - Boolean indicating if opportunity is closed
- `LeadSource` (aliased as `Opp_Original_Source`) - Original lead source

#### Opportunity Owner & Manager
- `Opportunity_Owner_Name__c` - Name of opportunity owner
- `OwnerId` - ID of opportunity owner
- `SGA__c` - Links to SGA (Sales) user
- Manager information pulled from User hierarchy

#### Outcome Fields
- `Stage_Entered_Signed__c` - When opportunity entered "Signed" stage
- `Closed_Lost_Reason__c` - Reason if closed lost
- `Closed_Lost_Details__c` - Details for closed lost opportunities
- `SQL__c` (aliased as `SQO_raw`) - Sales Qualified Opportunity field (string)
- `Date_Became_SQO__c` - When opportunity became an SQO
- `advisor_join_date__c` - When advisor actually joined Savvy

#### Qualification Information
- `Qualification_Call_Date__c` - Date of qualification call
- `Firm_Name__c` - Firm name
- `Firm_Type__c` - Type of firm
- `City_State__c` - City and state
- `Office_Address__c` - Office address

### User Enrichment (JOINs)

The CTE performs three LEFT JOINs to enrich opportunity data with user names:

1. **SGA User**:
```sql
LEFT JOIN `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.User` sga_user
  ON o.SGA__c = sga_user.Id
```
- Extracts SGA user name into `sga_name_from_opp`

2. **Opportunity Owner**:
```sql
LEFT JOIN `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.User` opp_owner_user
  ON o.OwnerId = opp_owner_user.Id
```
- Used to get ManagerId from owner record

3. **Manager**:
```sql
LEFT JOIN `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.User` manager_user
  ON opp_owner_user.ManagerId = manager_user.Id
```
- Extracts manager name into `sgm_name` (Sales Growth Manager)

---

## Final SELECT Statement

### Join Strategy
```sql
FROM Lead_Base l
FULL OUTER JOIN Opp_Base o
  ON l.converted_oppty_id = o.Full_Opportunity_ID__c
```

**Full Outer Join Logic**:
- **Match**: When a lead was converted to an opportunity, records are joined
- **Lead Only**: Leads that haven't converted yet (opportunity fields will be NULL)
- **Opp Only**: Opportunities that never had a lead record (lead fields will be NULL)

This ensures complete funnel visibility for both paths: lead â†’ opportunity AND direct opportunity entry.

### Attribution Join
```sql
LEFT JOIN `savvy-gtm-analytics.SavvyGTMData.Channel_Group_Mapping` g
  ON COALESCE(o.Opp_Original_Source, l.Lead_Original_Source) = g.Original_Source_Salesforce
```
- **Purpose**: Maps raw lead source to marketing channel groupings
- **Logic**: Prefers opportunity source, falls back to lead source
- **Output**: Provides cleaned channel names instead of raw Salesforce values

---

## Calculated Fields in Final SELECT

### Primary Key
```sql
COALESCE(l.Full_prospect_id__c, o.Full_Opportunity_ID__c) AS primary_key
```
- See [Primary Key Design](#primary-key-design) section above

### Advisor Name
```sql
COALESCE(o.Opp_Name, l.Prospect_Name) AS advisor_name
```
- Uses opportunity name if available, otherwise uses prospect name
- Ensures we always have a name for reporting

### SGA Owner Name
```sql
CASE
  WHEN l.Full_prospect_id__c IS NULL THEN o.sga_name_from_opp
  WHEN l.SGA_Owner_Name__c = 'Savvy Marketing' THEN o.sga_name_from_opp
  ELSE l.SGA_Owner_Name__c
END AS SGA_Owner_Name__c
```
- **Logic**:
  1. If no lead (opportunity-only), use opportunity SGA
  2. If lead is owned by "Savvy Marketing" (likely unassigned), use opportunity SGA
  3. Otherwise use lead SGA
- **Purpose**: Ensures accurate ownership tracking across the funnel

### Opportunity AUM
```sql
COALESCE(o.Underwritten_AUM__c, o.Amount) AS Opportunity_AUM
```
- **Purpose**: Single field for AUM value
- **Logic**: Prefers Underwritten AUM, falls back to Amount
- **Use Case**: Consistent AUM reporting

### Stage Name Code
```sql
CASE
  WHEN o.StageName = 'Qualifying' THEN 1
  WHEN o.StageName = 'Discovery' THEN 2
  WHEN o.StageName = 'Sales Process' THEN 3
  WHEN o.StageName = 'Negotiating' THEN 4
  WHEN o.StageName = 'Signed' THEN 5
  WHEN o.StageName = 'On Hold' THEN 6
  WHEN o.StageName = 'Closed' THEN 7
  ELSE NULL
END AS StageName_code
```
- **Purpose**: Numeric code for sorting stages in correct order
- **Use Case**: Sorting opportunities by sales stage progression
- **Note**: Stages without a code (e.g., "Closed Lost") will sort at the end

### Qualification Call Fields
```sql
CASE WHEN o.Qualification_Call_Date__c IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_Qual_call
```
- Binary flag indicating if qualification call occurred

```sql
FORMAT_DATE('%m/%d/%Y', DATE_TRUNC(DATE(o.Qualification_Call_Date__c), WEEK(MONDAY))) AS Week_Bucket_Qual_Call
```
- Weekly bucketing for qualification call date

### SQO Bucketing
```sql
FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%b', o.Date_Became_SQO__c) AS Month_bucket_SQO
```
- Month abbreviation for SQO date (e.g., "Jan", "Feb")

```sql
FORMAT_DATE('%m/%d/%Y', DATE_TRUNC(DATE(o.Date_Became_SQO__c), WEEK(MONDAY))) AS Week_bucket_SQO
```
- Weekly bucket for SQO date

```sql
DATE_TRUNC(DATE(o.Date_Became_SQO__c), WEEK(MONDAY)) AS Week_Bucket_SQO_Date
```
- Week start date for sorting/grouping

### is_joined Flag
```sql
CASE WHEN o.advisor_join_date__c IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_joined
```
- **Purpose**: Indicates if advisor has actually joined Savvy
- **Logic**: True when `advisor_join_date__c` has a value
- **Business Logic**: Final stage of funnel - advisor is fully onboarded

### Filter Date Fallback
```sql
COALESCE(
  l.FilterDate,
  o.Opp_CreatedDate,
  o.Date_Became_SQO__c,
  TIMESTAMP(o.advisor_join_date__c)
) AS FilterDate
```
- **Purpose**: Ensures FilterDate exists even for opportunity-only records
- **Fallback Chain**:
  1. Lead FilterDate (if lead exists)
  2. Opportunity Created Date
  3. SQO Date
  4. Advisor Join Date
- **Use Case**: Single date field for filtering all records

### Attribution & Channel
```sql
IFNULL(g.Channel_Grouping_Name, 'Other') AS Channel_Grouping_Name
```
- Maps lead source to marketing channel (e.g., "Paid Search", "Referral")
- Uses "Other" as default for unmapped sources

```sql
COALESCE(o.Opp_Original_Source, l.Lead_Original_Source, 'Unknown') AS Original_source
```
- Single source field with fallback chain
- Ensures we always have an attribution source

## Funnel Stage Definitions

Based on the view, the funnel stages are:

1. **Lead Created** - `CreatedDate` is populated
2. **Contacted** (`is_contacted = 1`) - Lead entered "contacting" stage
3. **MQL** (`is_mql = 1`) - Call was scheduled
4. **SQL** (`is_sql = 1`) - Lead converted to opportunity
5. **SQO** - Opportunity became Sales Qualified Opportunity (`Date_Became_SQO__c` populated)
6. **Qualification Call** (`is_Qual_call = 1`) - Qualification call occurred
7. **Signed** - Opportunity entered "Signed" stage (`Stage_Entered_Signed__c` populated)
8. **Joined** (`is_joined = 1`) - Advisor officially joined (`advisor_join_date__c` populated)

### Important Notes on Stage Definitions

- **SQL vs SQO**: SQL is simply conversion from lead to opportunity. SQO is a separate qualification step within the opportunity.
- **No `is_sqo` flag**: Unlike MQL/SQL/Joined, SQO is identified by checking `Date_Became_SQO__c IS NOT NULL` or `SQO_raw = 'SQL'` (if needed)
- **Flexible entry points**: Records can enter the funnel at any stage (lead creation, opportunity creation, or later stages)

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Funnel Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT primary_key) as total_leads,
  SUM(is_contacted) as contacted,
  SUM(is_mql) as mqls,
  SUM(is_sql) as sqls,
  SUM(is_joined) as joined
FROM savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2
WHERE FilterDate >= '2024-01-01'
```

### 2. Conversion Rates
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(is_sql) * 100.0 / SUM(is_mql) as mql_to_sql_rate,
  SUM(is_joined) * 100.0 / SUM(is_sql) as sql_to_joined_rate
FROM savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2
WHERE FilterDate >= '2024-01-01'
```

### 3. Channel Performance
```sql
SELECT 
  Channel_Grouping_Name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT primary_key) as leads,
  SUM(is_mql) as mqls,
  SUM(is_sql) as sqls,
  SUM(is_joined) as joined
FROM savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2
WHERE FilterDate >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY Channel_Grouping_Name
```

### 4. Opportunity-Only Records
```sql
SELECT *
FROM savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2
WHERE Full_prospect_id__c IS NULL  -- No lead record
AND Full_Opportunity_ID__c IS NOT NULL  -- Has opportunity
```

### 5. Weekly Funnel Trends
```sql
SELECT 
  Week_Bucket_MQL_Date,
  SUM(is_mql) as mqls,
  SUM(is_sql) as sqls,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Date_Became_SQO__c IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as sqos
FROM savvy-gtm-analytics.savvy_analytics.vw_funnel_lead_to_joined_v2
WHERE Week_Bucket_MQL_Date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY Week_Bucket_MQL_Date
ORDER BY Week_Bucket_MQL_Date
```

---

## Important Considerations

### Data Quality
- Always filter by `FilterDate` for accurate date-based reporting
- Some records may have incomplete stage progression (e.g., joined but never scheduled call)
- Not all leads will have all stages populated

### Performance
- View uses FULL OUTER JOIN which can be expensive on large datasets
- Consider filtering by date ranges when querying
- Primary key allows for efficient row lookups when needed

### Business Logic Assumptions
- MQL = Call Scheduled (only one definition in the view)
- SQL = Converted Lead (only one definition)
- Joined = Advisor Join Date populated
- **SQO requires checking date field** (no binary flag like other stages)

---
