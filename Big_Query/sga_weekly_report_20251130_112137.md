### 4. Coach's Corner (Conversion Diagnostics)

This section provides specific, data-driven coaching for each SGA based on conversion bottlenecks and disposition analysis.

**SYSTEMIC NOTE:** Contacting activity was below average for every single SGA last week. This is likely due to the Thanksgiving holiday. We need a strong rebound this week to fill the pipeline for December.

#### **Inbound Team**

-   **Lauren George:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Lauren is a top performer, but her Contacted→MQL rate has diminished from a lifetime 11.1% to 4.8% in the last 90 days. Her MQL losses show a high rate of "Not a Fit" (30% vs. team 13.6%) and "Not Interested in Moving" (20% vs. team 14.2%).
    -   **Coaching:** While her volume is high, there's an opportunity to improve lead quality. Review the last 10 leads marked "Not a Fit" to identify patterns. Is the lead scoring model working? Are there specific inbound channels delivering lower-quality leads that need adjustment?

-   **Jacqueline Tully:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Jacqueline is crushing her goal. Her MQL→SQL conversion has dramatically improved to 78.4% (vs. lifetime 33.4%), well above the team average. However, her MQL losses, though few, are dominated by "No Book" (40%) and "No Show / Ghosted" (40%), both significantly higher than team averages.
    -   **Coaching:** Celebrate the massive improvement in qualification. For the "No Show" issue, review her meeting confirmation process. Is she clearly articulating the value of the call in her confirmation emails and calendar invites to reduce no-shows?

#### **Outbound Team**

-   **Russell Armitage:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Russell is leading the outbound team and has already hit his goal. His primary bottleneck is SQL→SQO conversion at 69.2% (vs. team 78.9%). His MQL loss dispositions show a very high rate of "No Response" (19% vs. team 6.5%) and "AUM / Revenue too Low" (26.2% vs. team 15.7%).
    -   **Coaching:** The high "No Response" rate suggests his follow-up cadence on booked calls may need tightening. The high "AUM too Low" indicates a targeting or early-stage qualification issue. **Recommendation:** Implement a stricter AUM pre-qualification question earlier in the initial call to avoid wasting time on non-ICP leads.

-   **Eleni Stefanopoulos:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Eleni has hit her goal, but her funnel efficiency has dropped. Her MQL→SQL rate is only 21.9% (vs. team 43.7%). Her MQL loss dispositions show abnormally high rates for "Timing" (11.7% vs. team 4.5%) and "Restrictive Covenants" (10% vs. team 4.2%).
    -   **Coaching:** The high "Timing" losses suggest a need for a stronger nurturing strategy. Are these leads being added to a long-term follow-up sequence? The "Restrictive Covenants" issue points to a need for better upfront screening. **Recommendation:** Add a specific question about non-competes/non-solicits to the initial call script to disqualify these prospects earlier.

-   **Craig Suchodolski:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Craig's Contacted→MQL rate has fallen sharply to 2.0% (vs. lifetime 5.9%). His MQL losses are driven by "Not a Fit" at 26.3%, nearly double the team average of 13.6%.
    -   **Coaching:** The "Not a Fit" issue combined with low top-of-funnel conversion suggests a targeting problem. He's contacting a lot of people who are not right for our solution. **Recommendation:** Conduct a list-building and targeting review. Is he using the correct ICP criteria? Is the messaging resonating with the right audience?

-   **Amy Waller:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Amy is making steady progress. Her funnel is mostly stable, but her MQL losses are heavily skewed towards "Not a Fit" (36% vs. team 13.6%) and "No Book" (32% vs. team 17.8%).
    -   **Coaching:** Amy is disqualifying leads effectively, but she may be spending too much time on prospects who are fundamentally unqualified. **Recommendation:** Refine her initial discovery questions to screen for "No Book" and "Not a Fit" criteria within the first 5 minutes of the call.

-   **Ryan Crandall:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Ryan's funnel is stable but below team average on MQL→SQL (33.3% vs 43.7%) and SQL→SQO (71.4% vs 78.9%). His MQL losses are disproportionately high for "Auto-Closed by Operations" (16.7% vs. team 6.2%) and "No Book" (22.2% vs. team 17.8%).
    -   **Coaching:** The "Auto-Closed" disposition often points to leads that go stale without activity. This is a process issue. **Recommendation:** Review his lead management hygiene. Is he setting follow-up tasks for every lead? For "No Book," this is a qualification issue. He needs to screen for this earlier in his process.

-   **Channing Guyer:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Channing's Contacted→MQL rate is low at 2.4% (vs. team 4.2%). However, once he gets a meeting, his conversion is excellent (100% SQL→SQO). His MQL losses are overwhelmingly due to "No Show / Ghosted" (33.3% vs. team 6.8%).
    -   **Coaching:** The entire problem is getting people to show up for the first call. **Recommendation:** This is a critical coaching point. Review his pre-call communication. He needs to implement a robust confirmation process: a value-driven confirmation email, a reminder the day before, and potentially a same-day text reminder.

-   **Chris Morgan:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Chris has a significant MQL→SQL conversion problem, sitting at 24.3% (vs. team 43.7% and his lifetime 45.9%). His MQL loss dispositions clearly show why: "No Book" is very high at 26.3% (vs. team 17.8%).
    -   **Coaching:** He is booking meetings with advisors who don't have a portable book of business. This is a fundamental qualification miss. **Recommendation:** Role-play the first 5 minutes of his initial call to ensure he is asking direct questions about the prospect's book of business and AUM before proceeding.

-   **Helen Kamens:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Helen's biggest bottleneck is SQL→SQO conversion, which is only 50% (vs. team 78.9%). Her MQL losses are massively skewed by "Auto-Closed by Operations" at 33.3%, more than 5x the team average of 6.2%.
    -   **Coaching:** The "Auto-Closed" issue indicates a severe lead management problem; leads are dying on the vine. The poor SQL→SQO rate suggests the SQLs she passes are not fully qualified. **Recommendation:** 1) Implement a daily routine to review all open leads and ensure a next step/task is set for each. 2) Conduct a deep-dive review of her last 3 lost SQLs with her SGM to identify gaps in her qualification process.

-   **Perry Kalmeta:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Perry's Contacted→MQL rate has plummeted to 4.0% from a lifetime average of 16.2%. His MQL losses are driven by "No Show / Ghosted" (27.3% vs. team 6.8%) and "No Response" (18.2% vs. team 6.5%).
    -   **Coaching:** Perry is struggling to get engagement from his contacts. Like Channing, the "No Show" rate is a major red flag. **Recommendation:** Focus entirely on top-of-funnel engagement. Review his outreach messaging (is it compelling?) and implement a strict meeting confirmation process to combat the high no-show rate.

-   **Marisa Saucedo:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Marisa's funnel is struggling at every stage, with a critical SQL→SQO conversion rate of only 20% (vs. team 78.9%). Her MQL losses show a high "No Response" rate (12.8% vs. team 6.5%).
    -   **Coaching:** Marisa needs foundational support. The high "No Response" suggests her follow-up on booked calls is ineffective. The 20% SQL→SQO rate is a critical failure point. **Recommendation:** Pair Marisa with a top performer like Russell or Eleni for call shadowing. Review her call recordings for the last 5 SQLs to diagnose qualification gaps. She needs immediate, hands-on coaching to rebuild her process.

### 5. Source Alerts

-   **Positive Trend:** **Marketing / Re-Engagement** is performing exceptionally well, with a SQO generation rate +41.8pp higher in the last 90 days compared to the 365-day average. This is a highly effective channel.
-   **Negative Trend:** Key outbound channels are underperforming. **Outbound / LinkedIn (Self Sourced)** is down -1.53pp, and **Outbound / Provided Lead List** is down -1.14pp. This decline may be contributing to the top-of-funnel struggles for several outbound reps. We need to investigate if this is a messaging, targeting, or platform issue.

#### Date Range Dimensions & Filters

1.  **QTD (Quarter to Date):**
    -   Start: First day of current quarter (calculated as: month = (current_month - 1) // 3 * 3 + 1, day = 1)
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Used for: QTD SQO counts, quarterly goal progress

2.  **Last 7 Days:**
    -   Start: Current date - 7 days
    -   End: Current date (inclusive, includes today)
    -   When run on Sunday, this gives Monday-Sunday (8 days total: today + 7 days back)
    -   Date Dimension: `Date_Became_SQO__c` for SQOs, `Initial_Call_Scheduled_Date__c` for initial calls, `Qualification_Call_Date__c` for qualification calls
    -   Used for: Recent production, activity tracking

3.  **Next 7 Days (Upcoming):**
    -   Start: Current date + 1 day (tomorrow, excludes today)
    -   End: Current date + 7 days (7 days total starting from tomorrow)
    -   When run on Sunday, this gives next Monday-Sunday (7 days total: tomorrow + next 6 days)
    -   Date Dimension: `Initial_Call_Scheduled_Date__c` for initial calls, `Qualification_Call_Date__c` for qualification calls
    -   Used for: Calendar visibility, activity planning

4.  **Last 90 Days (Trailing 90):**
    -   Start: Current date - 90 days
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
    -   Used for: Conversion rate trends, activity averages, disposition analysis
    -   **Note:** For conversion rates, this is compared against "Lifetime (Post-Ramp)" which excludes the first 30 days after SGA creation

5.  **Lifetime (Post-Ramp):**
    -   Start: SGA CreatedDate + 30 days (excludes ramp period)
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
    -   Used for: Baseline conversion rates, historical performance comparison

6.  **Trailing 365 Days:**
    -   Start: Current date - 365 days
    -   End: Current date (inclusive)
    -   Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
    -   Used for: Channel/source performance comparison (90d vs 365d)

#### Key Calculations

1.  **Conversion Rates:**
    -   **Contacted → MQL:** `COUNT(DISTINCT contacted_to_mql_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_contacted_conversions)`
    -   **MQL → SQL:** `COUNT(DISTINCT mql_to_sql_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_mql_conversions)`
    -   **SQL → SQO:** `COUNT(DISTINCT sql_to_sqo_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_sql_conversions)`
    -   Source: `vw_sga_funnel` view with progression flags
    -   Date filtering: Applied via `FilterDate` field

2.  **Ramp Period Logic:**
    -   SGAs are considered "On Ramp" if `days_since_creation <= 30`
    -   Ramp period = First 30 days after SGA `CreatedDate` from `SavvyGTMData.User`
    -   Lifetime metrics exclude this 30-day period: `WHERE FilterDate >= DATE_ADD(User.CreatedDate, INTERVAL 30 DAY)`

3.  **SQO Deduplication:**
    -   Uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Full_Opportunity_ID__c, SGA_Owner_Name__c ORDER BY Date_Became_SQO__c DESC)`
    -   Ensures each opportunity is counted once per SGA, using the most recent SQO date

4.  **Pipeline Forecast:**
    -   Daily Rate = `QTD SQOs / Days Elapsed in Quarter`
    -   Remaining Days = Total days in quarter - Days elapsed
    -   **December Adjustment:** Days in December are multiplied by 0.67 (33% reduction) to account for holiday season
    -   Projected SQOs = `QTD SQOs + (Daily Rate * Remaining Days)`
    -   For December days: `(Daily Rate * 0.67 * December Days)`

5.  **Contacting Activity:**
    -   Metric: Count of records where `stage_entered_contacting__c` is not null
    -   Average Weekly Contacts = `Total Contacts (Last 90 Days, Post-Ramp) / Weeks in Period`
    -   Weeks in Period = `(Days in Period - Ramp Days) / 7`
    -   Comparison: Last 7 Days contacts vs. Average Weekly Contacts

6.  **Disposition Analysis:**
    -   **Closed Lost MQLs:** `is_mql = 1 AND is_sql = 0 AND Disposition__c IS NOT NULL`
    -   **Closed Lost SQLs:** `is_sql = 1 AND is_sqo = 0 AND Disposition__c IS NOT NULL AND StageName = 'Closed Lost'`
    -   Grouped by `Disposition__c` for each SGA
    -   Compared: Last 90 Days vs. Lifetime (Post-Ramp) vs. Team Aggregate (Last 90 Days)

7.  **Team Aggregate Calculations:**
    -   All team metrics aggregate data across all active SGAs (excluding: 'Savvy Marketing', 'Corey Marcello', 'Bryan Belville', 'Anett Diaz')
    -   Team conversion rates use the same formulas as individual SGAs but aggregate all eligible records
    -   Team disposition analysis aggregates all closed lost MQLs/SQLs across the team

#### Global Filters Applied
- `IsSGA__c = TRUE` AND `IsActive = TRUE` (from `SavvyGTMData.User`)
- `SGA_Owner_Name__c NOT IN ('Savvy Marketing', 'Corey Marcello', 'Bryan Belville', 'Anett Diaz')`

#### SGA Segmentation
- **Inbound SGAs:** Lauren George, Jacqueline Tully (handle inbound leads)
- **Outbound SGAs:** All other active SGAs (responsible for outbound prospecting)
- Rankings and comparisons are done within each segment
