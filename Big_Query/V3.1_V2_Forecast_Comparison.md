# V3.1 + V2 Challenger Forecast Comparison

**Date:** Q4 2025 Forecast  
**Models Used:**
- **Top of Funnel (MQLs):** ARIMA_PLUS (`model_arima_mqls`)
- **Top of Funnel (SQLs):** V3.1 Super-Segment Model (`model_tof_sql_regressor_v3_1_final`)
- **Bottom of Funnel (SQL→SQO):** V2 Challenger Model conversion rate

## Q4 2025 Forecast Results

### Using Trailing Rates (Segment-Averaged)

| Metric | Forecast | Method |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **MQLs** | **512.9** | ARIMA_PLUS |
| **SQLs** | **179.6** | V3.1 Super-Segment Model |
| **SQOs** | **98.6** | SQLs × 54.93% (Trailing Rate) |

**SQL→SQO Conversion Rate:** 54.93% (average trailing rate across all segments)

---

### Using V2 Challenger Rate (69.3%)

| Metric | Forecast | Method |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **MQLs** | **512.9** | ARIMA_PLUS |
| **SQLs** | **179.6** | V3.1 Super-Segment Model |
| **SQOs** | **124.5** | SQLs × 69.3% (V2 Challenger Rate) |

**SQL→SQO Conversion Rate:** 69.3% (validated V2 Challenger rate from Q3 2024 backtest)

---

## Key Differences

| Conversion Method | SQO Forecast | Difference |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Trailing Rates (54.93%)** | 98.6 SQOs | Baseline |
| **V2 Challenger (69.3%)** | 124.5 SQOs | **+25.9 SQOs (+26.3%)** |

**Analysis:**
- V2 Challenger rate (69.3%) is **higher** than trailing rate (54.93%)
- This results in **25.9 more SQOs** forecasted using V2 rate
- V2 rate represents a more optimistic/aggressive conversion assumption

## Model Architecture Details

### V3.1 Super-Segment Model (`model_tof_sql_regressor_v3_1_final`)

**Input:**
- Training Table: `tof_v3_1_daily_training_data`
- Aggregation: Daily by Super-Segments (Outbound, Inbound_Marketing, Partnerships_Referrals, Other)
- Features: Temporal (day_of_week, month, is_weekend) + Lagged rolling averages (7-day, 28-day)
- Model Type: BOOSTED_TREE_REGRESSOR

**Output:**
- SQL forecasts aggregated across all super-segments
- Q4 2025 Total: **179.6 SQLs**

### V2 Challenger Model

**Conversion Rate:** 69.3%
- Source: Q3 2024 backtest validation
- Calculation: 9.01 predicted SQOs / 13 cohort SQLs
- Status: Validated, production-ready

---

## Comparison with Current Production Forecast

**Current Production (ARIMA_PLUS + V2 Challenger):**
- MQLs: 512.9 (same)
- SQLs: ~226.9 (ARIMA_PLUS)
- SQOs: ~139.6 (SQLs × 58.23% live rolling rate)

**V3.1 + V2 Challenger (Trailing Rates):**
- MQLs: 512.9 (same)
- SQLs: **179.6** (V3.1 model)
- SQOs: **98.6** (trailing rate) or **124.5** (V2 rate)

**Key Differences:**
- V3.1 forecasts **47.3 fewer SQLs** than ARIMA_PLUS (179.6 vs 226.9)
- With trailing rates: **41.0 fewer SQOs** (98.6 vs 139.6)
- With V2 rate: **15.1 fewer SQOs** (124.5 vs 139.6)

---

## Recommendations

1. **For Conservative Forecasts:** Use V3.1 + Trailing Rates (98.6 SQOs)
   - More conservative, segment-averaged conversion
   - Reflects historical performance

2. **For Optimistic Forecasts:** Use V3.1 + V2 Challenger Rate (124.5 SQOs)
   - Higher conversion rate (69.3%)
   - Validated against recent performance
   - More aligned with current live rates (58.23%)

3. **Best Practice:** Use V3.1 + Live Rolling Rates (similar to current production)
   - Would be approximately: 179.6 SQLs × 58.23% = **104.6 SQOs**
   - Balances between trailing (54.93%) and V2 (69.3%) rates

---

## Notes

- V3.1 model forecasts significantly fewer SQLs than ARIMA_PLUS (179.6 vs 226.9)
- This may reflect the model's more conservative approach or different pattern recognition
- Trailing rates (54.93%) are calculated as segment-averaged historical rates
- V2 Challenger rate (69.3%) is a single validated rate from Q3 2024 backtest
- Live rolling rate (58.23%) sits between the two and may be the best compromise
