### 4. Coach's Corner (Conversion Diagnostics)

**Team Averages (Last 90 Days):** Contacted→MQL: 4.6%, MQL→SQL: 43.3%, SQL→SQO: 78.0%

**Inbound SGAs**
-   **Lauren George & Jacqueline Tully:** Both are performing exceptionally well. Their conversion rates are significantly above team averages at nearly every stage. The primary focus should be on maintaining momentum and ensuring their calendars don't go empty, as Lauren's is next week.

**Outbound SGAs**
-   **Russell Armitage:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Russell's top-of-funnel is strong (Contacted→MQL at 7.7% is +3.1pp vs team). However, his MQL→SQL conversion has dropped vs. his lifetime average. His disposition analysis reveals the cause: **'No Response' (19.0% vs team 6.5%)** and **'AUM / Revenue too Low' (26.2% vs team 15.7%)** are significantly elevated. He's struggling to re-engage MQLs and is accepting lower-quality leads into the funnel.
    -   **Coaching:** Review his MQL follow-up cadence. Are his emails and voicemails compelling enough to secure the next meeting? Tighten his initial qualification criteria to filter out low-AUM prospects earlier, saving time and focusing effort on higher-potential leads.

-   **Eleni Stefanopoulos:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Eleni's MQL→SQL rate is a major bottleneck at **21.2% (-22.1pp vs team)**, a sharp decline from her lifetime average of 43.8%. Her disposition data shows an abnormally high rate of losses due to **'Timing' (11.7% vs team 4.5%)** and **'Restrictive Covenants' (10.0% vs team 4.2%)**.
    -   **Coaching:** The 'Timing' issue suggests a need for a better long-term nurturing strategy. Let's build a 3-6 month follow-up plan for these prospects. The 'Restrictive Covenants' spike indicates a need to refine her discovery questions to uncover these deal-killers earlier in the conversation.

-   **Craig Suchodolski:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Craig's primary challenge is at the very top of the funnel. His Contacted→MQL rate is low at **2.6% (-2.0pp vs team)** and has fallen sharply from his lifetime 5.9%. His MQL losses are disproportionately high for **'Not a Fit' (26.3% vs team 13.6%)**. This indicates a potential targeting or messaging issue.
    -   **Coaching:** Let's review the lead lists and personas Craig is targeting. Is his outreach messaging resonating with the ideal customer profile? Role-play his initial pitch to ensure he's effectively communicating the value proposition to the right audience.

-   **Amy Waller:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Amy's MQL→SQL conversion is slightly below average at 37.0% (-6.3pp vs team). The root cause is clear in her dispositions: **'No Book' (32.0% vs team 17.8%)** and **'Not a Fit' (36.0% vs team 13.6%)** are massive outliers. She is spending time on prospects who are fundamentally unqualified.
    -   **Coaching:** Amy needs immediate coaching on pre-qualification. Let's refine her initial discovery questions to screen for "No Book" and "Not a Fit" issues within the first 5 minutes of a call. This will free up her time to focus on viable prospects.

-   **Ryan Crandall:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Ryan's MQL→SQL conversion is a bottleneck at **33.3% (-9.9pp vs team)**. His MQL loss dispositions show a significant spike in **'Auto-Closed by Operations' (16.7% vs team 6.2%)** and **'No Book' (22.2% vs team 17.8%)**.
    -   **Coaching:** The 'Auto-Closed' spike suggests a process issue—leads may be aging out without proper follow-up. Let's review his CRM workflow and task management. The 'No Book' issue, similar to Amy's, requires tighter pre-qualification questions upfront.

-   **Channing Guyer:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Channing is excellent once he gets a conversation started (MQL→SQL and SQL→SQO are well above average). His issue is getting prospects to show up. His Contacted→MQL rate is low (2.4%), and his disposition data shows a critical problem: **'No Show / Ghosted' accounts for 33.3% of his MQL losses**, nearly 5x the team average of 6.8%.
    -   **Coaching:** This is a correctable issue. Implement a mandatory 24-hour pre-call confirmation process (email and call). Review his meeting invites to ensure the value proposition is clear and compelling. He's doing the hard work to book the meeting; now we need to make sure they stick.

-   **Chris Morgan:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Chris is struggling across the funnel, with MQL→SQL at **28.0% (-15.3pp vs team)** and SQL→SQO at **61.5% (-16.4pp vs team)**. His MQL losses are driven by **'No Book' (26.3% vs team 17.8%)**. He is letting unqualified leads get too far, which wastes time and hurts his conversion rates downstream.
    -   **Coaching:** Focus on front-end qualification. Chris needs to be more rigorous in identifying non-ICP prospects early. Role-play discovery calls with a focus on asking tough qualifying questions about AUM and book of business upfront.

-   **Helen Kamens:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Helen's conversion rates are low at every stage, particularly SQL→SQO at **50.0% (-28.0pp vs team)**. Her MQL disposition data shows a massive spike in **'Auto-Closed by Operations' (33.3% vs team 6.2%)**, indicating a significant follow-up or lead management issue.
    -   **Coaching:** The 'Auto-Closed' rate is a major red flag for process adherence. We need to immediately audit her lead management workflow in the CRM. Is she setting follow-up tasks? Is she letting leads go stale? This is the top priority for coaching.

-   **Perry Kalmeta:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Perry's Contacted→MQL rate has plummeted from a lifetime 16.2% to just 5.6%. His MQL losses are disproportionately from **'No Show / Ghosted' (27.3% vs team 6.8%)** and **'No Response' (18.2% vs team 6.5%)**. Like Channing, he's struggling to make booked meetings happen and re-engage prospects.
    -   **Coaching:** Implement the same pre-call confirmation strategy as Channing. For the 'No Response' issue, let's review his follow-up email and voicemail scripts to ensure they are concise, value-driven, and have a clear call to action.

-   **Marisa Saucedo:**
    -   **Diagnosis:** Marisa is facing critical performance challenges. Her MQL→SQL (20.0%) and SQL→SQO (20.0%) rates are the lowest on the team by a wide margin. Her MQL losses are high for **'No Response' (12.8% vs team 6.5%)**. She is failing to convert initial interest into meaningful conversations.
    -   **Coaching:** Marisa needs intensive, hands-on coaching. Start with call shadowing and role-playing for both initial and qualification calls. We need to diagnose where the conversations are breaking down and rebuild her process from the ground up, focusing on discovery, value proposition, and closing for the next step.

-   **Brian O'Hara (On Ramp):**
    -   **Coaching:** Brian is progressing as expected for a new hire. The focus this week should be on continued learning, shadowing top performers like Russell and Eleni, and practicing mock calls.

### 5. Source Alerts

-   **Positive Trend:** **Marketing / Re-Engagement** is performing exceptionally well, with a SQO generation rate of 146% in the last 90 days, a significant increase of +41.8pp over the 365-day average. This is a highly effective channel right now.
-   **Negative Trend:** Core outbound channels are underperforming. **Outbound / LinkedIn (Self Sourced)** has dropped from a 2.25% conversion rate to just 0.72% (-1.53pp). **Outbound / Provided Lead List** has also seen a significant decline. This may indicate list fatigue or a need to refresh messaging on these channels.

- **User Data:** `SavvyGTMData.User` - Contains SGA creation dates for ramp period calculations

#### Date Range Dimensions & Filters

1. **QTD (Quarter to Date):**
   - Start: First day of current quarter (calculated as: month = (current_month - 1) // 3 * 3 + 1, day = 1)
   - End: Current date (inclusive)
   - Used for: QTD SQO counts, quarterly goal progress

2. **Last 7 Days:**
   - Start: Current date - 7 days
   - End: Current date (inclusive, includes today)
   - When run on Sunday, this gives Monday-Sunday (8 days total: today + 7 days back)
   - Date Dimension: `Date_Became_SQO__c` for SQOs, `Initial_Call_Scheduled_Date__c` for initial calls, `Qualification_Call_Date__c` for qualification calls
   - Used for: Recent production, activity tracking

3. **Next 7 Days (Upcoming):**
   - Start: Current date + 1 day (tomorrow, excludes today)
   - End: Current date + 7 days (7 days total starting from tomorrow)
   - When run on Sunday, this gives next Monday-Sunday (7 days total: tomorrow + next 6 days)
   - Date Dimension: `Initial_Call_Scheduled_Date__c` for initial calls, `Qualification_Call_Date__c` for qualification calls
   - Used for: Calendar visibility, activity planning

4. **Last 90 Days (Trailing 90):**
   - Start: Current date - 90 days
   - End: Current date (inclusive)
   - Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
   - Used for: Conversion rate trends, activity averages, disposition analysis
   - **Note:** For conversion rates, this is compared against "Lifetime (Post-Ramp)" which excludes the first 30 days after SGA creation

5. **Lifetime (Post-Ramp):**
   - Start: SGA CreatedDate + 30 days (excludes ramp period)
   - End: Current date (inclusive)
   - Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
   - Used for: Baseline conversion rates, historical performance comparison

6. **Trailing 365 Days:**
   - Start: Current date - 365 days
   - End: Current date (inclusive)
   - Date Dimension: `FilterDate` (TIMESTAMP field)
   - Used for: Channel/source performance comparison (90d vs 365d)

#### Key Calculations

1. **Conversion Rates:**
   - **Contacted → MQL:** `COUNT(DISTINCT contacted_to_mql_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_contacted_conversions)`
   - **MQL → SQL:** `COUNT(DISTINCT mql_to_sql_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_mql_conversions)`
   - **SQL → SQO:** `COUNT(DISTINCT sql_to_sqo_progression) / COUNT(DISTINCT eligible_for_sql_conversions)`
   - Source: `vw_sga_funnel` view with progression flags
   - Date filtering: Applied via `FilterDate` field

2. **Ramp Period Logic:**
   - SGAs are considered "On Ramp" if `days_since_creation <= 30`
   - Ramp period = First 30 days after SGA `CreatedDate` from `SavvyGTMData.User`
   - Lifetime metrics exclude this 30-day period: `WHERE FilterDate >= DATE_ADD(User.CreatedDate, INTERVAL 30 DAY)`

3. **SQO Deduplication:**
   - Uses `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Full_Opportunity_ID__c, SGA_Owner_Name__c ORDER BY Date_Became_SQO__c DESC)`
   - Ensures each opportunity is counted once per SGA, using the most recent SQO date

4. **Pipeline Forecast:**
   - Daily Rate = `QTD SQOs / Days Elapsed in Quarter`
   - Remaining Days = Total days in quarter - Days elapsed
   - **December Adjustment:** Days in December are multiplied by 0.67 (33% reduction) to account for holiday season
   - Projected SQOs = `QTD SQOs + (Daily Rate * Remaining Days)`
   - For December days: `(Daily Rate * 0.67 * December Days)`

5. **Contacting Activity:**
   - Metric: Count of records where `stage_entered_contacting__c` is not null
   - Average Weekly Contacts = `Total Contacts (Last 90 Days, Post-Ramp) / Weeks in Period`
   - Weeks in Period = `(Days in Period - Ramp Days) / 7`
   - Comparison: Last 7 Days contacts vs. Average Weekly Contacts

6. **Disposition Analysis:**
   - **Closed Lost MQLs:** `is_mql = 1 AND is_sql = 0 AND Disposition__c IS NOT NULL`
   - **Closed Lost SQLs:** `is_sql = 1 AND is_sqo = 0 AND Disposition__c IS NOT NULL AND StageName = 'Closed Lost'`
   - Grouped by `Disposition__c` for each SGA
   - Compared: Last 90 Days vs. Lifetime (Post-Ramp) vs. Team Aggregate (Last 90 Days)

7. **Team Aggregate Calculations:**
   - All team metrics aggregate data across all active SGAs (excluding: 'Savvy Marketing', 'Corey Marcello', 'Bryan Belville', 'Anett Diaz')
   - Team conversion rates use the same formulas as individual SGAs but aggregate all eligible records
   - Team disposition analysis aggregates all closed lost MQLs/SQLs across the team

#### Global Filters Applied
- `IsSGA__c = TRUE` AND `IsActive = TRUE` (from `SavvyGTMData.User`)
- `SGA_Owner_Name__c NOT IN ('Savvy Marketing', 'Corey Marcello', 'Bryan Belville', 'Anett Diaz')`

#### SGA Segmentation
- **Inbound SGAs:** Lauren George, Jacqueline Tully (handle inbound leads)
- **Outbound SGAs:** All other active SGAs (responsible for outbound prospecting)
- Rankings and comparisons are done within each segment
