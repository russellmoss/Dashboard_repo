## Key Definitions

### Capacity (SGM Capacity)
**Capacity** is the primary forecast metric representing the expected quarterly joined Margin AUM an SGM's active pipeline can produce.

- **Formula:** Capacity = Active Weighted Pipeline Value × SQO→Joined Conversion Rate
- **Logic:** Uses an SGM's active, healthy pipeline (non-stale SQOs) and multiplies it by their historical probability of converting deals, giving a realistic, stable forecast based on past performance.
- **Active Weighted Pipeline Value:** The weighted, estimated value only for non-stale deals (using dynamic thresholds: <$5M ≤90 days, $5M-$15M ≤120 days, $15M-$30M ≤180 days, ≥$30M ≤240 days). This is the most realistic forecast metric for capacity planning.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Understanding Capacity Estimate**
- **Capacity is NOT what will close in the current quarter.** It represents the forecasted value of deals coming down the pipeline that are expected to close over time.
- **Capacity is a forward-looking metric** that helps answer: "Do we have enough SQOs and Margin AUM in the pipeline to support all our SGMs hitting their $36.75M quarterly target?"
- **Interpretation:**
  - **Current Quarter:** Compare "Current Quarter Actuals" (what has already closed) to the $36.75M target to see who has met/exceeded their target this quarter.
  - **Future Quarters:** Compare "Capacity" to the $36.75M target to assess whether SGMs have enough pipeline to hit future quarterly targets.
  - **Pipeline Sufficiency:** A Capacity of $36.75M means the SGM has enough pipeline value (when weighted by conversion probability) to theoretically hit their target, but these deals may close across multiple quarters.
- **Why This Matters:** SGMs earn commission based on hitting their $36.75M quarterly target. Capacity helps ensure they have sufficient pipeline to achieve this, while Current Quarter Actuals shows what they've already achieved.

### Coverage (Coverage Ratio)
**Coverage** measures whether an SGM's Capacity is sufficient to hit their quarterly target.

- **Formula:** Coverage Ratio = Capacity / Target
- **Target:** The quarterly goal is $36.75M in Margin AUM per SGM, per quarter.
- **Example:** A Coverage Ratio of 1.20 means the SGM has 120% of the capacity needed to hit their $36.75M target. A ratio of 0.75 means they only have 75% of the capacity needed.

### Coverage Status Categories
Each SGM is automatically assigned a coverage status:

- **On Ramp:** The SGM's user account was created in the last 90 days. Their capacity is not calculated, as they are presumed to be ramping.
- **Sufficient:** Coverage Ratio ≥ 1.0 (100%+). This SGM's active pipeline forecast meets or exceeds their quarterly target.
- **At Risk:** Coverage Ratio ≥ 0.85 but < 1.0 (85%-99%). This SGM is close to having enough capacity but is in a "warning" zone.
- **Under-Capacity:** Coverage Ratio < 0.85 (<85%). This SGM has a significant gap in their pipeline and requires immediate attention.

### Pipeline Analysis Context
This report analyzes the **TOTAL OPEN PIPELINE** (all active SQOs and deals, regardless of when they were created) to ensure SGMs have sufficient pipeline to hit their quarterly targets. While the target is quarterly, we cannot predict exactly when deals will close, so we maintain a continuous pipeline that should contain enough SQOs and deals to support quarterly targets. The goal is to ensure SGMs have the right amount of SQOs and deals in their pipeline to hit their numbers across quarters, recognizing that deals may close in different quarters than when they entered the pipeline.

### Stale Pipeline
An SQO is flagged as "stale" using **dynamic thresholds based on deal size** (V2 Logic):

- **Small Deals (<$5M):** Stale if open >90 days
- **Medium Deals ($5M-$15M):** Stale if open >120 days
- **Large Deals ($15M-$30M):** Stale if open >180 days
- **Enterprise Deals (≥$30M):** Stale if open >240 days

This recognizes that larger, more complex deals naturally take longer to close. The average time from SQO to Joined is 77 days, but enterprise deals often take 120+ days. A high stale % (e.g., >30%) is a major red flag that the SGM's pipeline is inflated and needs cleanup, but enterprise-focused SGMs (like Bre McDaniel) may have longer cycles that are still healthy.

## Forecast Methodology & Confidence Guidelines

### Model Overview

This report uses a multi-layered forecasting framework based on the V2 Capacity Model, which has demonstrated approximately **89% accuracy** in backtests with a slight conservative bias (-11% error). The model uses:

1. **Deal-Size Dependent Velocity:** Enterprise deals (>$30M) are modeled at 120 days, Large deals ($15M-$30M) at 90 days, Standard deals (<$15M) at 50 days
2. **Dynamic Valuation:** When Margin_AUM is missing, uses Underwritten_AUM / 3.30 or Amount / 3.80
3. **Stage Probabilities:** Each deal stage (Discovery, Sales Process, Negotiating, Signed) has a specific probability of eventually reaching "Joined"
4. **Probability Penalties:** Recent deals (<6 months) receive penalties to reflect current market conditions

### Confidence Levels

**High Confidence (90%+):**
- Trend and sufficiency signals (e.g., "SGM has enough pipeline" or "SGM is starving for leads")
- Coverage Ratio assessments (Capacity vs. Target)
- Pipeline gap identification

**Medium Confidence (75%+):**
- Exact dollar figures for the quarter, especially when forecast relies on multiple deals
- Expected End of Quarter forecasts with diversified pipeline

**Lower Confidence:**
- Forecasts that depend heavily on 1-2 Enterprise deals in early stages (e.g., "Negotiating")
- Quarters where a single large deal represents >50% of expected revenue

### Key Limitations & Interpretation Guidelines

1. **Binary Outcome Problem:** The model uses expected value (EV). A $50M deal at 10% probability shows as "$5M expected," but reality is "$0 or $50M" - never $5M. For Enterprise-focused SGMs (like Bre McDaniel), treat forecasts as "Deal Potential" rather than precise cash-flow predictions.

2. **Timing Uncertainty:** We use deal-size dependent cycle times, but large deals often take 120+ days. If a large deal is marked "Overdue," it might just be complex, not dead.

3. **Human-in-the-Loop Required:** These numbers are **directionally correct** but should always be reviewed with qualitative judgment, especially for:
   - Enterprise deals in early stages
   - SGMs with pipeline concentrated in 1-2 large deals
   - Quarters where seasonality may affect outcomes

4. **View as Planning Tool:** The model excels at identifying pipeline gaps and capacity issues. Use it to answer "Do we have enough iron in the fire?" rather than "Exactly how much will close this quarter?"

### How to Use Quarterly Forecasts

- **Current Quarter Actuals:** What has already closed (factual)
- **Expected End of Quarter:** Current Actuals + Pipeline Forecast for rest of quarter (directionally correct, medium confidence)
- **Expected Next Quarter:** Pipeline forecast for deals projected to close next quarter (leading indicator of future capacity)

**Critical Rule:** If an SGM's forecast relies heavily on 1-2 large Enterprise deals, flag it as "At Risk" regardless of what the model says, due to binary outcome nature.

### **Pipeline Health Diagnostic & Action Plan**

**To:** Sales Leadership
**From:** Revenue Operations Partner
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Q4 Pipeline Analysis: Strong Current Quarter Performance Masking Significant Next-Quarter Risk

### 1. HIGH-LEVEL ALERTS & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This quarter's performance is a tale of two realities. On the surface, we are tracking well ahead of our firm-level target, largely due to the monumental performance of our Enterprise SGM, Bre McDaniel, and top producer, Corey Marcello. Together, they have already closed $158.6M, single-handedly pushing the team past 70% of its quarterly goal. This success, however, masks significant underlying risks that place next quarter in jeopardy. Our firm-wide Coverage Ratio of 1.77 is healthy in aggregate but dangerously misleading, as it is inflated by top performers while two SGMs remain under-capacity and are starving for pipeline.

The most critical bottleneck in our funnel is at the bottom: the **SQO-to-Joined conversion rate has dropped by 5.3 percentage points** (from 9.8% to 4.4%) over the last 90 days compared to the 12-month average. While SGAs are successfully converting leads at a higher rate than before (SQL→SQO rate is up 7.7 points), deals are stalling or dying once they reach the SGMs. This indicates a problem with either deal progression, pipeline quality, or both.

**Critical Alerts Requiring Immediate Attention:**
1.  **Next Quarter Crash Risk:** The velocity-based forecast for next quarter is only **$76.39M**, and the deal-size adjusted model shows only **$87.26M**. Both are alarmingly insufficient to support our quarterly target of $330.8M.
2.  **Massive "Slip Risk":** There is **$328.42M** in revenue attached to overdue deals that should have already closed based on a 70-day cycle. This pipeline is at high risk of being lost or pushed indefinitely.
3.  **Individual SGM Starvation:** Despite a healthy firm-wide coverage, **Jade Bingham (0.61 ratio) and Bryan Belville (0.80 ratio)** are mathematically starving for leads and cannot hit future targets without immediate pipeline injection.
4.  **Pipeline Bloat & Hygiene:** **GinaRose Galli's pipeline is 39.1% stale**, with her entire current quarter forecast dependent on overdue deals. This is an unsustainable and high-risk position.

**Overall Assessment: At Risk.** While we will likely exceed our target this quarter, this is a lagging indicator. The forward-looking metrics—a weak next-quarter forecast, a significant drop in closing conversion rates, and a massive volume of overdue deals—all signal that we are not building enough healthy pipeline to sustain this performance.

### 2. CAPACITY & COVERAGE ANALYSIS

Our total open pipeline capacity appears strong, but this is a dangerously skewed average. We must focus on individual readiness to get a true picture of health.

*   **Current Quarter Readiness:** Two SGMs have already secured their quarter.
    *   **Exceeded Target:** **Bre McDaniel ($121.71M)** and **Corey Marcello ($36.90M)**.
    *   **Close to Target:** **GinaRose Galli (83.8%)** is close, but her success depends entirely on closing aging deals. **Bryan Belville (63.4%)** and **Erin Pearson (54.0%)** are within striking distance but need to close their remaining pipeline.

*   **Next Quarter Readiness:** The outlook is poor. The deal-size adjusted forecast shows only **$87.26M** in the pipeline for next quarter against a **$330.8M** target. Only Bre McDaniel ($44.43M) has a healthy next-quarter forecast. This is our most significant leading indicator of a future revenue gap.

*   **Firm-Wide Capacity Gap:** The firm shows a capacity *surplus* of **$70.8M**, with a healthy **1.77 Coverage Ratio**. This number is not actionable as it's almost entirely driven by Bre and Corey's massive pipelines. The real story is in the breakdown.

*   **Coverage Status Breakdown:**
    *   **Sufficient (4 SGMs):** Driven by outliers.
    *   **At Risk (0 SGMs):** The model shows no one in this middle ground; SGMs are either thriving or starving.
    *   **Under-Capacity (2 SGMs):** **Jade Bingham** and **Bryan Belville** require immediate intervention.
    *   **On Ramp (3 SGMs):** Monitoring required to ensure they build pipeline effectively.

### 3. SQO PIPELINE DIAGNOSIS

We are facing a significant volume deficit in our total open pipeline, which is the root cause of our weak forward-looking forecast.

*   **Quantity Analysis:** We are mathematically short on the fuel needed for future quarters.
    *   **Firm-Wide SQO Gap (Total): 238 SQOs.**
    *   **Firm-Wide SQO Gap (Active Only): 255 SQOs.**
    *   This gap is a direct threat to our ability to hit targets in subsequent quarters.

*   **Quality Analysis:** While the firm-wide stale rate is a healthy 6.2%, this average hides critical hygiene issues with specific SGMs who are bloating the pipeline with aged deals.
    *   **GinaRose Galli:** **39.1% Stale Pipeline.** This is unacceptable and requires immediate cleanup. Many of her deals are over 250 days old, including one at 740 days.
    *   **Corey Marcello:** **11.4% Stale Pipeline.** While he is a top performer, this level of bloat requires attention to ensure focus remains on winnable deals.

*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The SQO gap is a shared challenge. The primary bottleneck is the **5.3 percentage point drop in the SQO→Joined conversion rate**.
    *   **SGA Perspective:** SGAs are performing well at the top of the funnel; the SQL→SQO rate is up 7.7 points. They are successfully creating qualified opportunities for SGMs.
    *   **SGM Perspective:** The conversion drop from SQO to Joined points to challenges in the SGM-owned stages. This could be due to a lack of effective deal progression, poor pipeline management (letting deals go stale), or potentially a decline in the underlying quality of SQOs that only becomes apparent late in the sales cycle. The high volume of stale deals with GinaRose and Corey supports the theory of a pipeline management issue.

### 3a. REQUIRED SQOs & JOINED PER QUARTER ANALYSIS (With Volatility Context)

The baseline requirement for a standard SGM to hit their target is **40 SQOs per quarter**. However, this metric is based on highly volatile historical data and must be used as directional guidance, not a rigid target.

**CRITICAL VOLATILITY CONTEXT:**
*   **Average Margin AUM/Joined:** $11.35M
*   **Coefficient of Variation:** **48.8% (Extremely High)**. The standard deviation is nearly half the average.
*   **Actual Range of Deals:** $3.75M to $23.09M.
*   **Interpretation:** An SGM's true SQO requirement can range from **24 to 56 SQOs** per quarter depending on the size of deals they close. SGMs closing smaller deals need more SQOs; those closing larger deals need fewer.

**SGM-Level SQO Gap Analysis:**

*   **Tim Mackey (On Ramp)**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 2 | **Gap: 38 (Significant Gap)**
*   **Ariana Butler (On Ramp)**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 5 | **Gap: 35 (Significant Gap)**
*   **Lexi Harrison (On Ramp)**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 5 | **Gap: 35 (Significant Gap)**
*   **GinaRose Galli**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 8 | **Gap: 32 (Significant Gap)** - Her pipeline is value-heavy but SQO-light, a risk for future quarters.
*   **Jade Bingham**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 15 | **Gap: 25 (Significant Gap)** - She has neither value nor volume. Highest risk SGM.
*   **Bryan Belville**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 16 | **Gap: 24 (Significant Gap)**
*   **Erin Pearson**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 19 | **Gap: 21 (Moderate Gap)**
*   **Bre McDaniel (Enterprise)**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 25 | **Gap: 15 (Close to Target)** - This metric is less relevant for her; her large deal size means she needs fewer SQOs. Her pipeline is healthy.
*   **Corey Marcello**
    *   Required SQOs: 40 | Current SQOs: 27 | **Gap: 13 (Close to Target)** - His pipeline is healthy on volume.

**Conclusion:** The three ramping reps and SGMs Jade, Bryan, and GinaRose have significant SQO volume gaps. They need immediate support in building a higher quantity of opportunities.

### 4. CONVERSION RATE ANALYSIS & TRENDS

Our funnel is compressing at the bottom. We are getting better at creating opportunities but worse at closing them.

*   **Overall Trends:**
    *   **SQL→SQO Rate (Good News):** Up **+7.7 points** this quarter. The handoff from SGA to SGM is improving in efficiency.
    *   **SQO→Joined Rate (Bad News):** Down **-5.3 points** in the last 90 days. This is the primary bottleneck and explains our weak forward-looking forecast.

*   **Channel & Source Performance:** The quality from key lead sources appears to be declining, which may contribute to the lower closing rate.
    *   **Ecosystem / Recruitment Firm:** SQO→Joined rate dropped **-10.0 points**.
    *   **Marketing / Re-Engagement:** SQO→Joined rate dropped **-6.2 points**.
    *   **Marketing / Event:** This channel has produced **zero SQLs** this quarter and its conversion rates have fallen off a cliff.

*   **Diagnostic Insights:** The data points to a combination of factors causing the closing bottleneck.
    *   **SGM Accountability:** The significant volume of stale and overdue deals suggests a breakdown in pipeline management and deal progression discipline among some SGMs.
    *   **Lead Quality Accountability:** The simultaneous drop in conversion rates from specific marketing and ecosystem sources suggests that the SQOs being created may be harder to close than in the past. This is a shared problem that requires a collaborative solution between SGAs, SGMs, and Marketing.

### 5. SGA PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The SGA team is performing well overall, particularly at converting SQLs to SQOs. The inbound team continues to be the bedrock of production, while several outbound SGAs are showing remarkable improvement.

**Inbound SGAs (Lauren George & Jacqueline Tully):**
*   **Top Performer:** **Lauren George** is the standout. She is the top volume producer (**20 SQOs**) and has improved her critical SQL→SQO rate by **+10.7 points**. She is the benchmark for performance.
*   **High Volume Contributor:** **Jacqueline Tully** remains a critical producer with **13 SQOs**. While her SQL→SQO rate saw a minor dip (-4.0 points), her high volume makes her essential to our pipeline health.

**Outbound SGAs:**
*   **Top Performers (Volume & Improvement):**
    *   **Russell Armitage:** Top outbound producer (**13 SQOs**) with a massive **+22.6 point** improvement in his SQL→SQO rate. An excellent example of growth.
    *   **Eleni Stefanopoulos:** Second-highest volume (**10 SQOs**). While her rates have declined, her volume is invaluable. Coaching should focus on restoring her conversion efficiency.
*   **Top Performers (Rate Improvement):**
    *   **Chris Morgan (+53.6 points)**, **Perry Kalmeta (+37.8 points)**, and **Craig Suchodolski (+23.6 points)** have all dramatically improved their SQL→SQO conversion rates. Their best practices should be studied and replicated across the team.
*   **Coaching Opportunity:**
    *   **Helen Kamens:** Needs urgent attention. Her SQL→SQO rate has plummeted by **-40.0 points** (from 40% to 0%). This is a critical performance issue that requires immediate coaching.

### 6. SGM-SPECIFIC RISK ASSESSMENT

*   **Under-Capacity SGMs (Highest Risk):**
    *   **Jade Bingham (Coverage: 0.61):** Has a $14.44M capacity gap and $0 in actuals this quarter. She has a significant SQO gap of 25. **Highest priority for intervention.**
    *   **Bryan Belville (Coverage: 0.80):** Has a $7.48M capacity gap and a 24 SQO gap. He is closer to target but needs an immediate pipeline boost to be healthy for next quarter.

*   **On Ramp SGMs:**
    *   Tim Mackey, Lexi Harrison, and Ariana Butler all have significant SQO gaps (38, 35, 35 respectively). This is expected, but they must be held accountable for building their initial pipeline now to avoid becoming under-capacity later.

*   **Sufficient SGMs (With Caveats):**
    *   **GinaRose Galli (Coverage: 1.35):** While "Sufficient," she is a high risk due to her **39.1% stale pipeline** and a 32 SQO gap. Her capacity is almost entirely composed of old, at-risk deals.
    *   **Bre McDaniel & Corey Marcello:** The gold standard for pipeline value and health. Corey needs to address his 11.4% stale pipeline, but his performance is exceptional.



### Required SQOs & Joined Per Quarter Analysis (With Volatility Context)

**📊 CALCULATION METHODOLOGY**

**Step 1: Required Joined = CEILING($36.75M Target / Average Margin AUM per Joined)**  
**Step 2: Required SQOs = CEILING(Required Joined / SQO→Joined Conversion Rate)**

**Firm-Wide Statistics (35 Non-Enterprise Deals, Last 12 Months):**
- **Average Margin AUM:** $11.35M
- **Median Margin AUM:** $10.01M
- **Standard Error:** $0.94M (95% CI: $9.52M - $13.19M)
- **Coefficient of Variation:** 48.8% (HIGH VOLATILITY)

**SQO→Joined Conversion Rate (Trailing 12 Months):**
- **Rate:** 10.04% (45 joined / 448 SQOs)
- **95% Confidence Interval:** 7.26% - 12.83%

**Why Exclude Enterprise Deals (>= $30M):**
- Bre McDaniel: 8 of 19 deals (42.1%) are >= $30M, avg $49.81M
- All Other SGMs: 0 deals >= $30M (max $21.15M)
- Including enterprise increases average by 63% ($11.35M → $18.51M) and volatility by 88% (48.8% → 91.5%)
- $30M cleanly separates enterprise-focused SGM from standard SGMs

**Volatility Range:**
- **Base Case:** 40 SQOs (using $11.35M avg, 10.04% conversion rate)
- **Range:** 24-56 SQOs (±16 SQOs) depending on actual deal sizes and conversion rates
- **Interpretation:** SGMs should plan for approximately **40 ± 16 SQOs per quarter**
