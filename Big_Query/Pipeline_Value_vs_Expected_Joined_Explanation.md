# Pipeline Value vs Expected Joined - Key Distinction

## The Confusion

You're asking: "Isn't the $148M already the margin AUM we think is going to convert? Why multiply by conversion rate?"

**Answer**: No - the $148M is the **total pipeline value**, but not all SQOs convert to Joined. The conversion rate accounts for the fact that only a percentage of SQOs actually become Joined.

## The Two Numbers Explained

### $148.07M = Active Weighted Pipeline Value

**What it represents:**
- Total weighted margin AUM of **all active SQOs** currently in Bre's pipeline
- Already weighted by stage probability (e.g., Negotiating deals count more than Discovery)
- Excludes stale deals (>120 days)
- This is the **total value of what's in her pipeline**

**Example breakdown:**
- Deal A: $10M margin AUM, Negotiating stage (70% prob) = $7M weighted
- Deal B: $5M margin AUM, Discovery stage (10% prob) = $0.5M weighted
- Deal C: $20M margin AUM, Signed stage (95% prob) = $19M weighted
- **Total Pipeline Value**: $26.5M weighted

**But**: Not all of these deals will actually join!

### $21.89M = Expected Joined Margin AUM (Capacity)

**What it represents:**
- Expected margin AUM that will **actually convert to Joined**
- Accounts for the fact that only 14.78% of SQOs historically become Joined
- This is the **realistic forecast** of what will join

**Calculation:**
```
$148.07M (Pipeline Value) × 14.78% (Conversion Rate) = $21.89M (Expected Joined)
```

## Why the Conversion Rate Matters

### Historical Reality:
- Not every SQO becomes a Joined advisor
- Some SQOs close lost
- Some SQOs stall and never close
- Some SQOs are disqualified

**Bre McDaniel's Historical Performance:**
- Conversion Rate: 14.78%
- This means: Out of 100 SQOs, only ~15 actually become Joined
- So: $148M in pipeline → Only ~$22M will actually join

---

## The Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Calculate Pipeline Value
```
Active SQOs × Stage Probability × Estimated Margin AUM = Pipeline Value
```
- This gives you: **What's in the pipeline** ($148M)
- This is optimistic - assumes all deals will close

### Step 2: Apply Conversion Rate
```
Pipeline Value × SQO→Joined Conversion Rate = Expected Joined
```
- This gives you: **What will actually join** ($21.89M)
- This is realistic - accounts for historical conversion

## Analogy

Think of it like a sales funnel:

**Pipeline Value ($148M):**
- All the deals in your pipeline
- "We have $148M worth of deals in various stages"

**Expected Joined ($21.89M):**
- What will actually close based on historical performance
- "Based on our 14.78% conversion rate, we expect $21.89M to actually join"

---

## Why Both Metrics Matter

### Pipeline Value ($148M):
- **Use for**: Pipeline health, deal quality, stage distribution
- **Shows**: Total opportunity in pipeline
- **Optimistic view**: "We have $148M in pipeline"

### Expected Joined ($21.89M):
- **Use for**: Capacity planning, forecasting, target setting
- **Shows**: Realistic forecast of what will join
- **Realistic view**: "We expect $21.89M to actually join"

---

## Example: Bre McDaniel

**Scenario:**
- Active Pipeline: $148.07M weighted value
- Historical Conversion Rate: 14.78%
- Expected Joined: $148.07M × 14.78% = **$21.89M**

**What this means:**
- She has $148M worth of deals in her active pipeline
- But historically, only 14.78% of SQOs become Joined
- So we expect only $21.89M to actually join
- The other $126M+ represents deals that won't convert (will close lost, stall, etc.)

## Summary

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Pipeline Value** | $148.07M | Total weighted margin AUM of all active SQOs in pipeline |
| **Conversion Rate** | 14.78% | Historical % of SQOs that become Joined |
| **Expected Joined (Capacity)** | $21.89M | Realistic forecast: Pipeline Value × Conversion Rate |

**Key Insight:**
- $148M = What's in the pipeline (optimistic)
- $21.89M = What will actually join (realistic)
- The difference ($126M) accounts for deals that won't convert

The conversion rate is critical because it accounts for the reality that not all SQOs become Joined advisors.
